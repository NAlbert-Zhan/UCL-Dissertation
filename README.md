# UCL Dissertation：From Reports to ESG Scores: A Deep Dive into US Firms’ Sustainability Reporting via NLP and LLMs

This project was a collaborative group effort with Zhengning Wu, Boyang Zhang, and Jiayou Qu, and I would like to note that there may be significant similarities in the methodology and some of the code used in our research due to shared discussions and resources. However, each team member focused on different industries and perspectives, which led to unique analyses and insights in our individual projects.
